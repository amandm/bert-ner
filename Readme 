# Algorithmic Pipeline for Receipt Information Extraction

## Pre-processing of the Image

### Input
- JPG images from the images directory.

### Processing Steps
- **Rotation Correction**: Automatically detect and correct the orientation of the receipt using image rotation detection algorithms.
- **Receipt Segmentation**: In case of multiple receipts in a single image, segment each receipt using contour detection or similar methods.
- **Image Quality Enhancement**: Adjust brightness, contrast, and sharpness to enhance text visibility.
- **Noise Reduction**: Apply filters to reduce image noise that can interfere with text recognition.

### Output
- Images prepared for text extraction, with each receipt isolated and properly oriented.

## Text Recognition (OCR)

### Input
- Pre-processed images from the previous step.

### Processing Steps
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Apply OCR technology (e.g., Tesseract, an open-source OCR engine) to convert images into text.
- **Text Cleanup**: Implement regular expressions and text cleaning techniques to remove noise. Be sure not to remove ".", it might give false amount. (100.000 wouold become 100000 Yen)
- **Character Segmentation**: Isolate individual characters or words within the identified text regions.
- **Character Recognition**: Convert segmented characters to digital text using OCR technology.

### Output
- Raw text extracted from each receipt.

## Information Extraction

### Input
- Raw text data from OCR.

### Processing Steps
- **Entity Recognition**: Using NER on japanese text or some other methods(e.g., use regular expressions to locate currency symbols followed by numerical values for amounts) to extract relavent information.
- **Data Extraction**: Extract and parse the 'issuer company' name and 'total amount' from the recognized patterns.
- **Keyword Identification**: Create a list of keywords or phrases that typically indicate the issuer company's name.

### Output
- Structured data containing the issuer company and total amounts for each receipt.

## Post-processing and Output

### Input
- Extracted data from the information extraction step.

### Processing Steps
- **Validation and Correction**: Check for common OCR errors in company names and amounts, applying correction rules as necessary.
- **Data Normalization**: Standardize data formats (e.g., convert all amounts to a standard currency format).
- **Error Correction**: Use error detection algorithms to correct common OCR mistakes.
- **Formatting**: Format the data into a structured array or JSON object.

### Output
- Final structured array where each object holds the "total amount" and "issuer company" values for each receipt.

## Storage

- **Action**: Store the output data in a specified format for further use or integration with other systems.

## Quality Assurance

- **Manual Verification**: Include an optional step where a human operator can verify and correct OCR results.
- **Feedback Loop**: Use incorrect extractions as feedback to improve the OCR model.
